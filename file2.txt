Ques:- What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Ans:-
       While Git is a tool that’s used to manage multiple versions of source code edits 
       that are then transferred to files in a Git repository, GitHub is a UI that serves
       as a location for uploading copies of a Git repository.

Ques:-  What is the difference Between Main Branch and Master Branch?
Ans:- 
        Previously, the name of the default branch of any repository was “master”. 
	But from October 2020 onward, the default branch of any GitHub repository 
	is using “main” as the default branch name, instead of master. 

Ques:-  Why Git is important?
Ans:-
        While talking about Git, the biggest advantage of Git is its branching capabilities. 
	Moreover, it is distributed version control system, which makes it more scalable. All
	the developers can work from their remote locations and contribute to the same piece of code.
