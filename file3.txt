Ques:-4. What is the difference between local & remote repositories? How to connect locally remotely?
Ans:-
         Git local repository is, that will be present inside your local machine.Git Remote repository
	 is, that where we stored the local repository in our local machines.
	 
	 
	 The main difference between local and remote repositories is that a local repository is accessed and managed directly on your local machine, 
	 whereas a remote repository is accessed and managed through a network connection to a remote server. Local repositories are generally used 
	 for personal work and experimentation, while remote repositories are typically used for collaboration, sharing, and backup purposes.

       To connect a local repository to a remote repository, you can use a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI) tool. 
       Here are the general steps to follow:

      --> Create a remote repository on a hosting service, such as GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab.
      --> Copy the URL of the remote repository.
      --> In the CLI or GUI tool, navigate to the local repository directory.
      --> Add the remote repository URL to the local repository using the following command:
      --> git remote add origin <remote-repository-URL>
      --> Push the local repository changes to the remote repository using the following command:
     --> git push -u origin master
     --> These steps assume you are using Git as your VCS. The origin is a convention used to refer to the remote repository.
     Master is the name of the main branch in your repository, but you can replace it with another branch name if necessary.
