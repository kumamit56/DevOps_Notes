MOST IMPORTANT INTERVIEW QUESTIONS ON AWS

Ques:-1 5 Aws services name you have used and whatâ€™s the use cases?
 Ans:- 
A. Amazon S3: Object storage service used to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere
   on the web. Used for hosting static websites, backup and archiving, and data lakes.

B. Amazon EC2: Virtual server instances used to run applications on the cloud. Used for web and 
   mobile applications, big data processing, and hosting databases.

C. Amazon RDS: Managed relational database service used to set up, operate, and scale a 
   relational database in the cloud. Used for hosting MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, 
   and MariaDB databases.

D. Amazon CloudFront: Content delivery network used to deliver data, videos, applications, and
   APIs to customers globally with low latency and high transfer speeds. Used for streaming media,    dynamic content, and accelerated content delivery.

E. Amazon SES: Email service used to send and receive email using a scalable and cost-effective 
   cloud infrastructure. Used for transactional email, marketing campaigns, and automated email 
   communications.

Ques:-2 What are the tools used to send logs to the cloud environment?
 Ans:-
        There are several tools that can be used to send logs to the cloud environment, including 
	Amazon CloudWatch Logs, AWS CloudTrail, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Other popular logging
	and monitoring tools include Splunk, Logstash, and Fluentd.

Ques:-3 What are IAM Roles? How do you create /manage them?
 Ans:-  
        IAM roles are a secure way to grant permissions to entities that you trust, such as AWS
        services, applications, or AWS Identity & Access Management(IAM) users. Roles eliminate            the need to share long-term access keys, making them a more secure and flexible way to
	control access to AWS resources. To create and manage IAM roles, you can use the AWS 
	Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs.

Ques:-4 How to upgrade or downgrade a system with zero downtime?
 Ans:-  
        To upgrade or downgrade a system with zero downtime, you can use techniques such as
	blue-green deployment, rolling deployment, or canary deployment.These techniques involve
	creating a duplicate environment, deploying the updated version to the duplicate
	environment, and gradually shifting traffic from the old environment to the new one.

Ques:-5 What is infrastructure as code and how do you use it?
 Ans:-  
        Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure
	using code rather than manual processes. IaC tools such as AWS CloudFormation, AWS CDK, and        Terraform enable developers to define infrastructure as code using a high-level language,          version control the code, and automate the deployment and management of infrastructure.
	This approach helps to improve consistency, reduce errors, and increase agility.

Ques:-6 What is a load balancer? Give scenarios of each kind of balancer based on your experience.
 Ans:-  
        A load balancer is a device or software that distributes network traffic across multiple
	servers to ensure that no single server is overwhelmed with traffic. There are several
	types of load balancers, including:-

        1. Application Load Balancer(ALB):- used to route HTTP/HTTPS traffic to specific endpoints            based on path, host, or query string.
	
        2. Network Load Balancer(NLB):- used to handle TCP and UDP traffic at the transport layer,            providing low latency and high throughput for applications.
  
        3. Classic Load Balancer(CLB):- used to distribute traffic across multiple instances in 
	   one or more Availability Zones, supporting both HTTP and TCP traffic.

Ques:-7 What is CloudFormation and why is it used for?
 Ans:-  AWS CloudFormation is a service that helps to model and provision AWS resources using 
        templates. With CloudFormation, you can create a collection of resources in a single,
	automated, and repeatable way. This helps to improve consistency, reduce errors, and 
	increase agility when deploying infrastructure in the cloud.

Ques:-8 Difference between AWS CloudFormation and AWS Elastic Beanstalk?
 Ans:-  
        AWS CloudFormation is a service that helps to model and provision AWS resources using
	templates. With CloudFormation, you can create a collection of resources in a single,
	automated, and repeatable way. This helps to improve consistency, reduce errors, and 
	increase agility when deploying infrastructure in the cloud.

Ques:-9 What are the kinds of security attacks that can occur on the cloud? And how can 
        we minimize them?
 Ans:-
        There are various types of security attacks that can occur on the cloud, including:
  
    --->DDoS attacks:- These can occur when a large number of requests flood a server or network,
                       rendering it inaccessible to legitimate traffic.
    --->Malware attacks:- Malicious software can be introduced into the cloud environment through
                          a variety of vectors, including email attachments, infected files, and
			  compromised user accounts.
    --->Data breaches:- Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud can occur when
                        security controls are not properly implemented or user credentials are
			compromised.
    --->Insider threats:- This type of attack occurs when a user with authorized access to the
                          cloud environment intentionally or unintentionally causes harm.

   To minimize security risks on the cloud, you can take the following steps:

   --->Ensure that you are using strong, unique passwords for all user accounts, and enable
       multi-factor authentication wherever possible.
   --->Keep your cloud environment updated with the latest security patches and updates.
   --->Implement network segmentation to reduce the potential impact of an attack.
   --->Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit.
   --->Regularly audit your cloud environment to identify any vulnerabilities or areas for
       improvement.

 Ques:-10 Can we recover the EC2 instance when we have lost the key?
  Ans:-
          If you have lost the key to an EC2 instance, you can still recover the instance by
	  creating a new key pair and then attaching the new key pair to the instance. Once
	  the new key pair is attached, you can log in to the instance using the new key and 
	  recover any data that was previously stored on the instance.
